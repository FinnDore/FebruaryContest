# FebuaryContest
Zephyr's first ever contest, make sure to start and watch this repo to stay up to date on standings and announcements.

## What is it?
A zephyr hosted competition with multiple categories. The idea would be to drive usage of our platform to get people to deploy things. Everyone will compete across categories and the Zephyr team will pick 3 winners across 4 categories which would win cash prizes. The Community will pick one winner per category based on up votes. For inspiration on what is possible, take a peek at our [blog](https://zephyr-cloud.io/blog), our [Examples repo](https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-examples) for web or our [examples repo for mobile](https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-repack-example) and don't forget to follow us on our [X](https://x.com/ZephyrCloudIO) account where we have shared multiple tutorials.
